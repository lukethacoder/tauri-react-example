## Tauri React Example

Simple [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) starter running with [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/). [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is running as our bundler of choice.

Should hopefully save some time trying to setup Tauri and React.

> Currently config'd to run on the [Cloudbridge](https://tauri.studio/docs/usage/patterns/cloudbridge) pattern.
